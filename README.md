### Hi, I'm Lorik 👋

👋 I'm Project Manager and Certified Scrum Master with a passion for Python, automation, and front-end development.

🌱 I’m currently building projects with Python (Tkinter, Pandas, automation tools) and expanding my skills in JavaScript.

🔭 I’m developing my personal portfolio website and several automation tools that blend data, design, and productivity.

💡 I enjoy using code to simplify workflows, visualize data, and turn ideas into practical solutions.

⚡ Check out my repositories to see what I’ve been working on. More coming soon!
